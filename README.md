Hello, I'm chosey.
I started as a hobby because I became interested in programming and changed my major 
from pharmaceutical engineering to computer engineering to gain more professional knowledge. 
My final goal is to become a front-end developer, 
and the reason I created a GitHub account is to upload algorithm problem solving. 
I look forward to your kind cooperation.
